# Maze-Solver

This project is a maze solver that utilizes Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the solution. The project uses the pyamaze library in Python to provide a visual representation of the maze and the path the algorithm follows when finding a solution.

## Requirements

- Python 
- Pyamaze library

## Usage

Clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```
pip install pyamaze
```
Run the code

```
python maze_solver_DFS.py
```
